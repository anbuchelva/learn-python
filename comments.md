1. Sending replit links to friends:  
    Even though replit has removed the feature to generate an offsite link for your friends to run,  I have found a work around by appending  `?embed=1&output=1`  to your repl link.   I have used this method to send my repls to my friends without the need for them to login to replit or create an account.
